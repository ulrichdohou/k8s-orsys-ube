This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and starting Minikube with the Docker driver.

---

## Prerequisites

- A machine with Docker installed and running
- `kubectl` installed and configured
- Internet access to download Minikube

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. Download and Install Minikube
Download the Minikube binary:
```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
```

Move the binary to a location in your PATH and make it executable:
```bash
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
minikube version
```

---

### 2. Start Minikube with the Docker Driver
Start a Minikube cluster using Docker as the driver:
```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

---

### 3. Verify Minikube Installation
Check the status of the Minikube cluster:
```bash
minikube status
```

Ensure all components are running correctly:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

---

## Additional Commands

### Open the Minikube Dashboard
Launch the Minikube dashboard in your default web browser:
```bash
minikube dashboard
```

### Access the Cluster via Minikube Tunnel
Expose Minikube services on your local machine:
```bash
minikube tunnel
```

---

## Notes

- Ensure Docker is running before starting Minikube.
- You can stop the cluster at any time with:
  ```bash
  minikube stop
  ```
- Delete the cluster if needed:
  ```bash
  minikube delete
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: Minikube fails to start.
  **Solution**: Ensure Docker is installed and running. Restart Docker and retry:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart docker
  ```

- **Issue**: Slow cluster startup.
  **Solution**: Increase Docker resources (CPU, memory) in your Docker settings.

- **Issue**: Cannot connect to cluster.
  **Solution**: Check the Minikube logs for details:
  ```bash
  minikube logs
  ```
